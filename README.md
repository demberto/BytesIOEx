BytesIOEx is a simple wrapper over Python's `io.BytesIO` which provides
additional methods for reading and writing C data types like **int8**,
**uint8**, **bool** and so on. The `read_*` methods are used for reading a
particular type from the stream and the `write_*` methods are used for writing
Python's basic data types **int**, **bool** and **float** to the stream. Both
these types of methods advance the steam position by the size of the data type.
The type conversion is handled by the `struct` module. `Struct` classes are
used to maximize the performance. **Native byteorder is used.**

## ‚è¨ Installation

BytesIOEx requires Python 3.6+, it may run on older version as well but I have
not tested it.

```
pip install --upgrade bytesioex
```

## üìú Documentation

Docs are available on [ReadTheDocs][docs].

## üöÄ Roadmap

- [ ] Ensure full coverage.
- [ ] Add `wchar` (UTF-16 character) support.
- [ ] Support for different byte orders.

## ‚ùï Motivation

C# `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter`.
